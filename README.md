### Goal Function Names for superopt-i386

- `-f<goal-function-name>`: This option specifies the goal function for the superoptimizer. The goal function names are:

    - `eq`: Equals. Computes the C expression `a == b`.
    - `ne`: Not equals. Computes `a != b`.
    - `les`: Less than or equal, signed. Computes `a <= b` with signed comparison.
    - `ges`: Greater than or equal, signed. Computes `a >= b` with signed comparison.
    - `lts`: Less than, signed. Computes `a < b` with signed comparison.
    - `gts`: Greater than, signed. Computes `a > b` with signed comparison.
    - `leu`: Less than or equal, unsigned. Computes `a <= b` with unsigned comparison.
    - `geu`: Greater than or equal, unsigned. Computes `a >= b` with unsigned comparison.
    - `ltu`: Less than, unsigned. Computes `a < b` with unsigned comparison.
    - `gtu`: Greater than, unsigned. Computes `a > b` with unsigned comparison.
    - `eq0`, `ne0`, `les0`, `ges0`, `lts0`, `gts0`: Similar to above, but these compute comparisons of `a` with zero (e.g., `a == 0`, `a != 0`, `a <= 0`, etc.).
    - `n<function>`: Negated version of the function. For example, `nlt` computes `-(a < b)`.
    - `maxs`, `mins`: Maximum and minimum of two arguments, signed comparison.
    - `maxu`, `minu`: Maximum and minimum of two arguments, unsigned comparison.
    - `sgn`: Sign function. Returns -1 for negative, 0 for zero, and +1 for positive arguments.
    - `abs`, `nabs`: Absolute value and negative absolute value, respectively.
    - `gray`, `gray2`: Gray code conversion functions. `gray` typically converts a binary number to its Gray code equivalent, and `gray2` might be a variation or related operation.

- Other functions: The list mentions "etc, etc," implying there are more functions available. Check the `goal.def` file for a complete list and definitions. You can also add custom goal functions to this file.

When using `-f<goal-function-name>`, replace `<goal-function-name>` with one of the functions from this list to specify the desired operation for the superoptimizer. The choice of function will determine what kind of code the superoptimizer tries to generate. This is particularly useful for finding efficient assembly sequences for specific operations or comparisons.
